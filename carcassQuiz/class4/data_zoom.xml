1. imageLink
Enter the path to your image. You can add a full path like this

3. zoomMax
Maximum percentage of zoom allowed. (400 means the image can be enlarged to 4 times bigger than original size):
Example values: "100", "150", "200", "400", "800" etc 

4. zoomOutToExtreme
How the image should display in the minimum zoom out condition. Two possible ways are
true: Show the entire image to fit within window 
false: Show the image to fit only one side (either height or width) and the otherside can be viwed by panning

5. zoomFactor
Speed and amount of zoom while clicking "+" and "-" buttons
Example values: "1", "2", "3", or fractions "1.5", "10.4" etc

6. panSpeed
Speed of movement of image while clicking the Left, Right, Up, Down Arrow buttons
Example values: "1", "2", "3", or fractions "1.5", "10.4" etc

7. panWithinBoundary
While dragging and panning whether we need to allow the content to amove anywhere or just within the canvas boundary
Make it "false" if you need to move the content freely.

8. ease
Smoothness of movement and smothness of zoom
Example values: "1", "2", "3", or fractions "1.5", "10.4" etc

9. usePanButtons
If you don't want the Left, Right, Up, Down Arrow buttons for pan option, (and just ok with drag option),
then make this value into "false"

10. useDragOption

11. controlBoxAutoHide
Show the control box only when the mouse presents within canvas area. Otherwise hide:

12. controlBoxAutoHideDelay 
Delay time in seconds to hide the control box 
Example values: 1,2,3, or fractions 1.5, 10.4 etc

13. controlBoxVAlign
You can position the control buttons box. This option is for vertical alignment
Example values: "top", "middle", "bottom"

14. controlBoxHAlign
This option is for horizontal alignment
Example values: "left", "center", "right"

15. controlBoxSpace
Space betwen corner of flash stage and control box in pixels
Example values: "1", "2", "3", "10", "20"...

16. controlBoxBgColor
Control box background color (value in hexadecimal)

17. controlBoxBgTransparency
Control box background transparency (in percentage)

18. controlButtonColor

You can set a custom default zoom value in percentage. Also clicking the reset button will revert back to this value. leave the value blank "" if you don't want to use this option.
Example values: "200", "100", "50"...

26. initialHorizontalAlign
If the initialZoomPercentage is set to some value and size of the image exceeds the canvas size, then we may need to align the image to show a particular initially.  This option can align the image either to "left" or "right". For center alignment, type "center" or just leave the value blank "".

27. initialVerticalAlign
If the initialZoomPercentage is set to some value and size of the image exceeds the canvas size, then we may need to align the image to show a particular initially.  This option can align the image either to "top" or "bottom". For center alignment, type "center" or just leave the value blank "".
